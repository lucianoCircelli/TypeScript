# TypeScript
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that compiles to clean JavaScript output.

In the time if experience, this customisation can shrink and goes in specific functions to call only a necessary. 
Initialy, I would my GH use standard forks from private brand with big organization and good reputation that knew all conflits.
To make sequences with my github account only seemms not feasible after 60 days without this repository on the machine I note that doesn't run.
Certainly, there is action but I afect much factors in the original repository.
